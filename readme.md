## Laravel 5 Bootstrat REST API

This is just some code that I find myself re-using regularly and it's quite handy. Most of the approaches here are something I learned in Jeffrey Way's videos on [Laracasts](http://www.laracasts.com), in Phil Sturgeon's book [Build APIs you won't hate](http://apisyouwonthate.com/) and other people's blogs, podcasts and packages.
Loads of things missing here and I wasn't going to upload the code until I put it in order, but quite a few people requested it, so... here it is - unfinished.

## Laravel (Thank you Taylor Otwell!)
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.
Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
